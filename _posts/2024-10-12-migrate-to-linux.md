I am not against Microsoft or Windows. It's a great Operating System that works for everyone. As someone said, it just works and that's what we need. I appreciate and respect that perspective. This article is not intended to brainwash Windows users to use Linux but instead to highlight how Linux has matured over the years and why does it even make sense for you to try.

Let's get to the point.

Linux has matured over the years and the open source community has showered lots of love and effort into making it better to use. Various flavors/distros of Linux have come out to meet the needs of the general public. With a huge list of apps and softwares available via Software Center and now, the introduction of Flatpaks, the possibilities of doing anything & everything in Linux has become so easy.

Yes. You needed to know the terminal, basic commands and so on. They were mandatory to know in the past. But now, the evolution of Linux have made it easy to do everything via GUI. Even if you don't know anything about terminal and commands, the open source community has so much of documentations and technology forums where you can find any command and use it. As of now, you can learn using Terminal as you go and it's not a show stopper.

### What are the most reliable Linux distros you can use?
> These are not listed in any specific order.

1. **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop)** (Debian based)
2. **[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)** (Debian based)
3. **[Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/)** (Debian based)
4. **[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)** (RPM based)
5. **[Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/)** (Debian based)

### Which distro do I recommend?
I recommend **[Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/)**. 
- It is Debian based and has lots of community support. 
- It is built on the Ubuntu which is proven and tested. 
- **[Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/)** has an intuitive desktop manager called the "**Cosmic**" which is so easy to navigate around.
- It comes with out of the box Flatpak support. So, finding an app in the Pop Shop (which is the Software Center of [Pop OS](https://github.com/pop-os/shop)) is a breeze. Every app that I have used is so stable and reliable.
- It uses very less resources in your machine and thus so fast even with the basic configurations your desktop/laptop may have.
- This operating system doesn't track you. You have control over everything. This is what we call as having "Freedom".
- 100% free for the Operating System and for all the apps you install from their Pop Shop.

### Why should you consider migrating to Linux?
1. **For freedom** - Freedom from what? Freedom from proprietary softwares which track you and that take advantage of your privacy to make profit. Your privacy is not for sale.
2. **For cost savings** - Linux has matured over the years and this wonderful community will keep pushing their spirit of innovation even further. Linux has been open source and free for all these years. Why to pay for expensive operating systems, softwares and recurring subscriptions when you can run everything on 100% free base?
3. **Every app is now available as a Web App** - If you don't have a flatpak or native Linux installer for a software, it is most likely that the product will have a Web version that can be run in a web browser. The world is betting every innovation to be supported for Web and Mobile. For example, Office 365,  Microsoft Office suite of products, Google suite of productivity apps, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, LinkedIn, YouTube, WhatsApp, Github, you name it - all work in web browsers.
4. **Less intensive on hardware resources** - making it super fast in running apps, commands and scripts.
5. **Full flexibility to customize** - You can customize Linux's shell, look and feel, install additional [gnome shell extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) if you don't like what comes vanilla out of the box.
6. **No need of extra drivers** - Gone are those days where drivers were needed for audio and video to work. Now, the most reputed Linux distros just work as soon as they are installed.
7. **Frequent OS updates** - Linux informs you via app notifications if updates are available. These updates are downloaded and installed so fast with some distros not even having the need to reboot.
8. **Secure** - Unlike Windows, Linux is very secure and less prone to malwares and cyber attacks. You know why? Because linux is open source. The community of developers, cyber securtity experts, testers evaluate it and contributes security patches constantly making it a rock solid.
9. **Hardware requirements are minimum** - Unlike Windows which keeps increasing the hardware requirements when they release new versions, Linux just needs the most minimal hardware configurations and it doesn't grow exponentially like Windows does.
10. **Servers run Linux. It's tried and tested** - Almost every cloud provider and their data centers run Linux heavily to reduce cost and increase performance. With the advent of containerization using Docker and Kubernetes, it has easy to spin up containers in Linux and deploy our applications and network docker containers for application frontend & backend to communicate seamlessly. Simply put, if you develop in Linux, test it, package it and it runs, it would run anywhere.

> Like we used to say **Windows just works**. Now, I can confidently say **Linux just works and much better than Windows**.

### What do I do with my Linux distro?
My personal laptop has Pop OS installed and I do a lot of programming, writing blogs, content production (youtube tutorials), learning new technologies & managing study notes, contributing to open source projects and all my personal tasks so easily.

### Any favorite softwares/apps you would recommend to be installed?
I personally use the following applications and these are too good from a productivity standpoint.

**Browsers**
- Brave
- Chrome
- Firefox

**Programming**
- VS Code (general IDE for programming all kinds of languages)
- Postman (API development and testing)
- drawio (for drawing technical diagrams)

**Libraries**
- Python3 (comes out of the box in Pop OS)
- Git (comes out of the box in Pop OS)
- OpenSSL (comes out of the box in Pop OS)

**Task Planning & TODO**
- Planify

**Video & Audio**
- OBS Studio (for video & audio recording & streaming)
- Kdenlive (for video editing)
- VLC Player (for supporting wide variety of audio file formats)

**Image Editing & Rendering**
- GIMP

**Mail & Calendar**
- Thunderbird

**Office Productivity**

My favorite Linux advocate [Derek Taylor](https://www.patreon.com/distrotube/about) (creator of the Youtube Channel [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DistroTube)) said **if you cannot find a software supported in Linux, then don't use it, find an open source alternative.**

### Testaments from great companies embracing Linux
