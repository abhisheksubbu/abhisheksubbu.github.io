## 9.3 million new jobs
The new business revenue projections will in turn create 3.8 million new direct jobs + 5.5 million indirect jobs.

- Direct jobs are those created in the Salesforce customer base from the revenues generated by the use of Salesforce and its ecosystem's cloud services.
- Indirect jobs are those created in the economy by people filling the direct jobs and by spending on local goods and services by Salesforce and its ecosystem.

3.8 million new direct jobs = 5.7 million jobs in 2026 - 1.9 million jobs in 2020

5.5 million new indirect jobs = 8.3 million jobs in 2026 - 2.8 million jobs in 2020

## How do we prepare to take advantage of this huge opportunity?
Salesforce and its ecosystem of partners and customers will have to find and upskill people into "Trailblazers" (Salesforce Professionals).
3 ways we can achieve this is by:

1. **Adoption of Trailhead**: Trailhead is a one-stop shop where people can learn in-demand skills for the future of work. It provides career paths for various Salesforce roles and is also introducing new roles to create entry points into some of the fastest growing fields today (like Marketer, Sales and Designer).
2. **Seek Guidance from Trailblazer Community**: Trailblazer Community is a network of 15 million people scross the Salesforce ecosystem who help each other learn new skills and succeed with Salesforce. Participating in this community definitely helps to perform well their roles and even get promotions.
3. **Partner Trainings**: Salesforce Consulting Partners and ISV Partners also conduct a lot of trainings with their efficient workforce. It is very important to accelerate new inductions, trainings and hire talent for new and diverse pipelines.
4. **Partner Business Readiness**: Throughout a customer's journey, partners fill technology whitespace and offer solutions across products, industries and regions. Therefore, it is crucial for partners to bring the power of apps and expertise to solve customer challenges.
