**_Linear Data Structures_** are a classification of Non-Primitive Data Structures that organizes data in a **sequential, single-level manner**.

## Features of Linear Data Structures

- Data Elements are arranged in an orderly manner
- Data Elements are attached adjacently
- Every Data Element can be accessed in one run/iteration
- Simple to Implement
- Memory Utilization is Ineffective because of linear placement
- Examples are [Array](/Array/), [Queue](/Queue/), [Stack](/Stack/), [Linked List](/linked-list/)
