A competent architect always has an intimate familiarity with the architectural body of knowledge. The software architect should

- Be comfortable with all branches of software engineering from requirements definition to implementation, development, verification, validation & deployment
- Be familiar with supporting disciplines such as configuration management and project management
- Understand current design and implementation tools and techniques
- Knowledge and Experience in one or more application domain is also necessary

The Knowledge Areas that a Software Architects needs to know are:

- Computer Science Knowledge
- Knowledge of Technologies and Platforms
- Knowledge about the Organization’s Context and Management

## Computer Science Knowledge
