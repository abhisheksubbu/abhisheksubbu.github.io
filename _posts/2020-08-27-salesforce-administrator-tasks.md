Every organization that is newly on-boarding into / using Salesforce needs a skilled Salesforce Administrator to succeed. In this blog, we will discuss what are the needs that a Salesforce Administrator should fulfill in an organization day in & day out.

## Who qualifies to be selected as a Salesforce Administrator?

- A candidate having a Salesforce Administrator Certification (honestly is useless) because it doesn't prove that the candidate knows to administer the complexities of an enterprise. This certification is just the first level.
- A candidate having Advanced Administrator Certification OR Platform App Builder + Platform Developer 1 can be preferred.
- Certifications alone are not enough. 3-5 years of experience in Salesforce is definitely required.

Most organizations say what is there so much for a Salesforce Administrator to do everyday. The reason why organizations have this perception is because of 2 reasons.

1. The decision makers in the organization do not understand various administrative elements in Salesforce.
2. They don't value the role of a salesforce administrator much and think it is a cost overhead for them to appoint a person fulltime.

## Why should you invest in a Salesforce Administrator for your organization?

1. They keep track of licenses, storage, limits if not administered, can become a costly affair.
2. They help optimize various declarative aspects like (Roles, Permissions, Profiles, Custom Permissions) so that the Salesforce implementations are neat & tidy.
3. They are the key personnel for running audits in the Salesforce instance. This helps to understand bottlenecks, scalability concerns, redudancies, violations to best practices.
4. They help strategize Backup & Disaster Recovery plans and processes to keep the organization safe from data loss or even at circumstances when you migrate away from / into Salesforce CRM.

Next section lists all the activities that a Salesforce Administrator needs to do in every organization.
