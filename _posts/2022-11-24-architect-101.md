**Architects** are the most respected & senior-most individuals in the Software Industry because of their deep understanding of fundamentals as well as the specific knowledge of products/platforms. In addition to these, architects also perform some project management responsibilities & leadership roles too. This makes them the most valuable people in an organization.

Almost 60-70% of the architects you will see in the industry are usually not competent because they spent so much time in their career on a single product/platform without focussing on the fundamentals & problem-solving capabilities.

An architect requires a sound understanding of his/her roles & responsibilities, strong knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals, expertise in any product/platform as well as project management methodologies.

#### Roles & Responsibilities

As an architect or an aspiring architect, you need to understand who an “Architect” is, what kinds of “architects” are there in the industry, and their roles & responsibilities. Some people get this itself wrong and spend so much time in their career and get stagnant. You don’t want to be making this mistake at the first place.
