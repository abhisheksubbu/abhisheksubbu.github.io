As a **developer/senior developer**, it is expected that you are strong in terms of Programming Fundamentals as well as have strong hands-on experience working on the technologies/platforms/languages that are you specializing on.

You should be allocating at least 2 hours everyday for practicing hands-on programming (be it on your project or as a separate learning if you are on bench). Practice is the key to becoming a great programmer. There is no other secret other than practice. Experience is only considered valuable if you have a culture of coding practice and as years pass by, you should know more problem solving techniques (not just naive but efficient ones).
