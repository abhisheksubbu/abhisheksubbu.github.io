        Stacks are powerful data structures that can help us solve many complex programming problems. Stacks can be used in some use-cases like Develop UNDO functionality, Build Compilers Evaluate Arithmetic Expressions, Develop navigation features in our application (moving forward and backward), etc Structure of a Stack Stacks can be visualized as a stack of books.

        Linked Lists are one of the most commonly used Linear Data Structures after arrays. They solve many problems of arrays and are used for building complex data structures. Unlike arrays, Linked Lists can grow and shrink automatically. A Linked List has a sequence of nodes. Every node has a value &amp; address to next node...

        Linear Data Structures are a classification of Non-Primitive Data Structures that organizes data in a sequential, single-level manner. Features of Linear Data Structures Data Elements are arranged in an orderly manner Data Elements are attached adjacently Every Data Element can be accessed in one run/iteration Simple to Implement Memory Utilization is Ineffective because of linear...

        Arrays are built into most programming languages and we use them to SORT a list of items sequentially. Since Arrays are a type of Linear Data Structures, they store data in the memory sequentially. For example, if we have a set of 5 integers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], they would be allocated in the...

Most of us accept this shift without understanding the WHY, WHAT, WHEN and HOW of Microservices. In this blog, we will try to understand What is essential for an organization to shift from Monolithic to Microservices Architecture...
