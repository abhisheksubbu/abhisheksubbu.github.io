I"ä<h2 id="why-should-we-version-our-apis">Why should we version our APIâ€™s?</h2>

<p>The first time we publish an API for clients to consume, then the users expect that the APIâ€™s do not change suddenly and break their integrations. But the fact is that new requirements will come to the developers maintaining the API and they have to somehow evolve the APIâ€™s without breaking the client integrations at any cost.</p>

<p>So, the only way around this is to version the APIâ€™s as new changes are rolled out. This gives clients the flexibility to use the previous versions of API and continue their business. They can parallely test the new API version on their sandbox and once tested successfully, roll over to the new API version.</p>
