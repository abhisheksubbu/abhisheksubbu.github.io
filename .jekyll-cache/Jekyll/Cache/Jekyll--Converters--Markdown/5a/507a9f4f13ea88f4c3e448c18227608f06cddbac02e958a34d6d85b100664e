I"K<p>There are many approaches to logging. Right from the simplest to most complex ones. In this blog, I will introduce a framework for logging in APEX language that uses Dependency Inversion principle.</p>

<h2 id="why-such-a-framework">Why such a framework?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I wanted to propose a consistent way for developers to log errors in Apex</li>
  <li>Simple Logger class with a LogMessage method used in various parts of apex increases coupling</li>
  <li>I should be able to deploy enhancements to the Logger without having the logger classes locked by runtime</li>
  <li>I also should be able to switch/swap logger implementations like changing <strong>Custom Object Logger</strong> to <strong>API Logger</strong>, etc</li>
</ul>
