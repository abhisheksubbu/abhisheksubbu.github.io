I"=<p>Every organization that is newly on-boarding into / using Salesforce needs a skilled Salesforce Administrator to succeed. In this blog, we will discuss what are the needs that a Salesforce Administrator should fulfill in an organization day in &amp; day out.</p>

<h2 id="who-qualifies-to-be-selected-as-a-salesforce-administrator">Who qualifies to be selected as a Salesforce Administrator?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A candidate having a Salesforce Administrator Certification (honestly is useless) because it doesn’t prove that the candidate knows to administer the complexities of an enterprise. This certification is just the first level.</li>
  <li>A candidate having Advanced Administrator cCertification OR Platform App Builder + Platform Developer 1 can be preferred.</li>
  <li>Certifications alone are not enough. 3-5 years of experience in Salesforce is definitely required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most organizations say what is there so much for a Salesforce Administrator to do so much everyday. The reason why organizations have this perception is because of 2 reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The organization decision makers do not understand various administrative elements in Salesforce</li>
  <li>They don’t value the role of a salesforce administrator much and think it is a cost overhead for them to appoint a person fulltime.</li>
</ol>
