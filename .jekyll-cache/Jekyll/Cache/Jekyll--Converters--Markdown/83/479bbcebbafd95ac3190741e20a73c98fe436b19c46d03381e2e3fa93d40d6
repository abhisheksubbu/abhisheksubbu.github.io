<p>The benefits of enterprise architecture are achieved through its direct and indirect contributions to organizational goals. It has been found that the most notable benefits of enterprise architecture can be observed in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Organizational design</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture provides support in the areas related to design and re-design of the organizational structures during mergers, acquisitions or during general organizational change.</li>
  <li><strong>Organizational processes and process standards</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture helps enforce discipline and standardization of business processes, and enable process consolidation, reuse, and integration.</li>
  <li><strong>Project portfolio management</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture supports investment decision-making and work prioritization.</li>
  <li><strong>Project management</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture enhances the collaboration and communication between project stakeholders. Enterprise architecture contributes to efficient project scoping and to defining more complete and consistent project deliverables.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements Engineering</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture increases the speed of requirement elicitation and the accuracy of requirement definitions, through the publishing of the enterprise architecture documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>System development</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture contributes to optimal system designs and efficient resource allocation during system development and testing.</li>
  <li><strong>IT management and decision making</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture is found to help enforce discipline and standardization of IT planning activities and to contribute to a reduction in time for technology-related decision making.</li>
  <li><strong>IT value</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture helps reduce the systemâ€™s implementation and operational costs and minimize the replication of IT infrastructure services across business units.</li>
  <li><strong>IT complexity</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture contributes to a reduction in IT complexity, consolidation of data and applications, and to better interoperability of the systems.</li>
  <li><strong>IT openness</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture contributes to more open and responsive IT as reflected through increased accessibility of data for regulatory compliance, and increased transparency of infrastructure changes.</li>
  <li><strong>IT risk management</strong> â€“ Enterprise architecture contributes to the reduction of business risks from system failures and security breaches. Enterprise architecture helps reduce risks of project delivery.</li>
