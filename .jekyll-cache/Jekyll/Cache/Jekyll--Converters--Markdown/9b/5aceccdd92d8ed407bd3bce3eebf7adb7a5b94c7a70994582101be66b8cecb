<p><strong>Non-Linear Data Structures</strong> are a classification of Non-Primitive Data Structures that organizes data in multilevel manner.</p>

<h3 id="features-of-non-linear-data-structures">Features of Non-Linear Data Structures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Data Elements are arranged in a sorted order</li>
  <li>A Data Element has a Hierarchical Relationship to another Data Element</li>
  <li>All Data Elements cannot be traversed in a single run/iteration</li>
  <li>Complex to Implement</li>
  <li>Memory Utilization is Effective since Data Elements are declared in memory dynamically as it arrives</li>
  <li>Examples are Tree &amp; Graph</li>
</ul>
