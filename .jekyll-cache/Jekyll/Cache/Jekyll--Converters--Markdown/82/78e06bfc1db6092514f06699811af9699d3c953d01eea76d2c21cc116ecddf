I"\<p>When it comes to Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, there are 2 main factors that need to be analyzed every time. Time taken by the algorithm to finish [Time Complexity] Space needed by the algorithm for running the computation [Space Complexity] If your algorithm takes infinite amount of time to complete running, then your algorithm isâ€¦</p>
