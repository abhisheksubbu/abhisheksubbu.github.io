I"Ü<p>Every organization that is newly on-boarding into / using Salesforce needs a skilled Salesforce Administrator to succeed. In this blog, we will discuss what are the needs that a Salesforce Administrator should fulfill in an organization day in &amp; day out.</p>

<h2 id="who-qualifies-to-be-selected-as-a-salesforce-administrator">Who qualifies to be selected as a Salesforce Administrator?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A candidate having a Salesforce Administrator Certification (honestly is useless) because it doesnâ€™t prove that the candidate knows to administer the complexities of an enterprise. This certification is just the first level.</li>
  <li>A candidate having Advanced Administrator Certification OR Platform App Builder + Platform Developer 1 can be preferred.</li>
  <li>Certifications alone are not enough. 3-5 years of experience in Salesforce is definitely required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most organizations say what is there so much for a Salesforce Administrator to do everyday. The reason why organizations have this perception is because of 2 reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The decision makers in the organization do not understand various administrative elements in Salesforce.</li>
  <li>They donâ€™t value the role of a salesforce administrator much and think it is a cost overhead for them to appoint a person fulltime.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you-invest-in-a-salesforce-administrator-for-your-organization">Why should you invest in a Salesforce Administrator for your organization?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>They keep track of licenses, storage, limits if not administered, can become a costly affair.</li>
  <li>They help optimize various declarative aspects like (Roles, Permissions, Profiles, Custom Permissions) so that the Salesforce implementations are neat &amp; tidy.</li>
  <li>They are the key personnel for running audits in the Salesforce instance. This helps to understand bottlenecks, scalability concerns, redudancies, violations to best practices.</li>
  <li>They help strategize Backup &amp; Disaster Recovery plans and processes to keep the organization safe from data loss or even at circumstances when you migrate away from / into Salesforce CRM.</li>
</ol>
