I"∏<h1>Architect Corner</h1>

<p><strong>Architects</strong> are the most respected &amp; senior-most individuals in the Software Industry because of their deep understanding of fundamentals as well as the specific knowledge of products/platforms. In addition to these, architects also perform some project management responsibilities &amp; leadership roles too. This makes them the most valuable people in an organization.</p>

<p>Almost 60-70% of the architects you will see in the industry are usually not competent because they spent so much time in their career on a single product/platform without focussing on the fundamentals &amp; problem-solving capabilities.</p>

<p>An architect requires a sound understanding of his/her roles &amp; responsibilities, strong knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals, expertise in any product/platform as well as project management methodologies.</p>

Some people get this itself wrong and spend so much time in their career and get stagnant. You don‚Äôt want to be making this mistake at the first place.</p>
