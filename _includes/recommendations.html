      Very few people have the capacity and courage to invest themselves in the
      company that they are working for. Abhishek is an exception. Since the day
      he joined Author Solutions, as a junior software engineer, I have
      considered him to be our asset. His productivity began shortly after he
      joined and delivered high quality of product throughout his entire career.
      In his early age at Author Solutions, he was devoted lots of time to
      Salesforce world and soon he became the best Salesforce resource I ever
      had. Abhishek was tasked to lead a team with finding software solutions
      and implementing workflow processes by assessing operational capability,
      troubleshooting and diagnostics, designing and calibrating system
      specifications, analyzing system processes, and other related duties. His
      overall duty was to streamline Salesforce processes and allow for
      efficient information flow and retrieval, and he did an excellent job in
      managing and improving our Salesforce organization consistently. He was
      promoted shortly after this achievement and has progressed nowhere but up
      from then on. As a Development Lead, Abhishek excels at supervising,
      guiding and motivating other members of the team. He is a natural leader
      and problem solver, easily identifying and proposing solutions to any road
      bumps that the team hits along the way. Abhishek is also great at staying
      on task. More than once, heâ€™s guided the group back to the immediate topic
      at hand when its focus had begun to err off track. Every company would be
      dreaming to have a resource like Abhishek is.

      Abhishek is the blend of hard work and a person of deep thought who will
      deliver the impossible when required at the right time. For him technology
      is his power and the technique of delivering it is his difference from
      others.His Go Green attitude and love for nature depicts the true love for
      mother nature and makes him a humanitarian. Well mannered and ordered
      person with clean good habits makes the person more adorable like his
      smile. He is is true "Tech Guru" if you are in need of technology.
